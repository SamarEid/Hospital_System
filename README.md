# Hospital_System
A simple hospital system where there is 
    - 20 different specialization (e.g. surgery, heart, etc)
    - each specialization can only have 5 patients waiting
the admin can 
    - add a patient
    - if 5 patients already exist, admin apologizes and doesn't accept
    - if the patient is urgent , he gets put in the front of the queue
    - admin can call a patient to see the doctor
    - admin can use print all patients in all the specializations
